    <p> 1. You Will Lose Everything You Love
Death, distance, or change will take it all—eventually.

This doesn’t mean love is worthless. It means love matters more—because it’s borrowed. Every embrace, every sunset, every child’s laughter... is a temporary miracle.
The truth: Appreciation is everything.
But also: Can you love while knowing it won’t last?

2. Nobody Really Knows What They’re Doing
Every generation is improvising. Every person is pretending some part.

Even your parents. Even the people you admire. Systems are built on guesses, traditions on survival, and confidence on repetition.
The truth: You must choose your own compass.
But also: You’ll have to lead while still uncertain.

3. Life is Not Fair, and Justice Is Not Guaranteed
Good people suffer. Evil people succeed. The scales don’t always balance here.

This hurts most when you care deeply. But the mature response isn’t despair—it’s to be just anyway.
The truth: You may not win the way you hoped.
But also: Can you choose goodness with no reward?

4. You Are Not Special—But You Are Sacred
You are one of billions. The universe doesn’t revolve around you.
But you’re also the only you that will ever exist.

This double-edged truth humbles the ego and uplifts the soul.
The truth: You’re not entitled to meaning.
But also: You can choose to make your life sacred through how you live.

5. You Will Betray Yourself at Least Once
There will come a moment when you lie, quit, avoid, or collapse. You will fall short of your ideal.

And yet—that’s not the end. Redemption is real.
The truth: You will not be your best every moment.
But also: You can still become someone you’re proud of.

6. Most People Are Afraid, Not Evil
The world looks cruel, but often it’s just people protecting themselves poorly.

Understanding this shifts you from reaction to compassion.
The truth: Pain is everywhere, hiding under masks.
But also: Will you join the pain, or transform it?

7. Freedom Costs Everything
To truly be free—to think for yourself, to live by your own code—you will lose comfort, approval, even love.

But anything less is a prison in disguise.
The truth: You must choose your chains—or break them all.
But also: Freedom means responsibility, not escape. </p>
